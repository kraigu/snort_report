== What is this library for?

This library provides a Ruby interface to a MySQL database and some helper
functions to write your own reports.

== Requirements

You'll need to also have the mysql and parseconfig gems installed.

== CAVEAT

I'm a terrible programmer and a newbie Ruby coder to boot. Let me know how to
fix things.

== Examples

You need to get a SnortDB instance and then call things against it.
		require 'snort_report'
		SnortDB = snortreport.connect("some crap")

== But I don't use MySQL

Then you've not tried any of the other reporting tools; they tend only to
support MySQL. Sorry. I hate it too. Code patches or bug reports for nonMySQL
DBs are welcome.

== License

BSD-new.
